## First 30 Days

Understanding & Assessment I begin by developing a deep understanding of

- Technical landscape: architecture, tech stack, and development practices
- Team dynamics: individual strengths, challenges, and growth opportunities
- Business context: product strategy and stakeholder needs
## Days 31-60

Setting Direction Building on these insights, I focus on:

- Establishing engineering standards and best practices
- Creating clear career development frameworks
- Optimizing delivery processes and team workflows
- Strengthening cross-functional relationships

## Days 61-90

Driving Excellence The foundation then enables:

- Implementation of sustainable engineering practices
- Launch of team growth and mentorship initiatives
- Development of technical roadmaps aligned with business goals
- Creation of meaningful engineering metrics
